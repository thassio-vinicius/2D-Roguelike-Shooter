# 2D Roguelike Shooter
 
This is a fully playable Demo version of a 2D Roguelike shooter, made in conjunction with James Doyle's Udemy Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/unityroguelike/

All design assets, arts, SFXs, tilemaps and gameplay features belongs to James, however, as instructed by the course, a lot of gameplay and game design features where implemented by me, those being: different types of enemies with different attack and movement patterns, new player weapons and characters, level designs, custom boss attacks and movement patterns, as well as minor bug fixes that weren't acknowledged by the course.
